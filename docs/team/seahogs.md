## Project: vitalconnect

This product is for doctors or any healthcare workers who need to keep track of a lot of patient information and require the information at a fast pace, preferring a simple UI such as a CLI instead of a complex GUI, with the added benefit of typed user commands for even faster retrieval of information. The app also has a timetable feature that allows the user to keep track of appointments. Below are my contributions to the project.

    - *Credits*: This feature was implemented inspired by the `add person` feature in the original AB3.

2. **Delete Medical Information**:
