## Installation

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. You learn how to do so [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your vitalConnect.

4. Open a command terminal or learn how to do so [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+open+a+command+terminal&rlz=1C1GCEA_enSG1015SG1015&oq=how+to+open+a+command+terminal&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQzMThqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

5. Type `cd` followed by the location of the folder that you are putting the `vitalconnect.jar` file in. Find out more [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt)

6. Type `java -jar vitalConnect.jar` and press Enter to launch java and run the application. A GUI should appear in a few seconds.

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all patients.

   * `add n/John Doe ic/S1234567D` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` with nric `S1234567D` to the Clinic.

## Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: General notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME ic/NRIC`, `NAME` and `NRIC` are parameters which can be used as `add n/John Doe ic/S1234567D`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `ic/NRIC p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER ic/NRIC` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Invalid prefixes may lead to unmatching error messages. For example, `editm ic/S1234567D H/8 W/2` will result in an error message saying that `NRIC is invalid...` instead of `invalid prefix`. This is because the whole part `S1234567D H/8 W/2` is treated as the NRIC.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

Format: `help`

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Patient Management
### Adding a patient : `add`

Adds a patient to the clinic using their identification information.

Format: `add ic/NRIC n/NAME`

* The NRIC **must** be a valid NRIC.

Examples:
* `add ic/S1234567D n/James Doe`

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

### Editing identification information : `edit`

Edits a patient's identification information.

Format: `edit ic/NRIC n/NAME`

* The NRIC must be a NRIC of an already existing patient.
* If you would like to change the name instead of the NRIC, create a new patient using `add` then use `delete` on the outdated version.

Examples:
* `edit ic/S1234567D n/John Doe`

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a patient : `delete`

Deletes the specified patient from the clinic.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the patient at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list.
* If the panel is currently not showing any patient list (e.g. showing appointment list), the default patient list is the general clinic patient list (which contains all the patients).
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
The deletion of a patient will result in the deletion of all the contact and medical information as well as all the appointments of the patient. <br> If accidentally delete a patient, can use `undo` command to recover the deleted patient. </div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd patient in the clinic.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st patient in the results of the `find` command.

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to Top</span>](#top)

### Listing all patients : `list`

Shows a list of all patients in the clinic.

Format: `list`

[<span style="font-size: small;">Back to table of contents</span>](#toc)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Contact Management

### Adding contact information : `addc`

Adds the contact information to a patient in the clinic.

Format: `addc ic/NRIC [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Additional notes about the command format:**<br>
Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `addc ic/S1234567D p/91234567 e/test@email.com`
</div>

* The NRIC must be a NRIC of an already existing patient.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Phone number should be of 3 to 15 digits long.
* Emails should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:
  1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters, and the special characters should not be adjacent to each other.
  2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
     The domain name must:
      - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
      - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
      - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.
* Address has a max length of 50 characters, and it should not be empty upon adding. Although in particular cases, the address can be larger than the current limit, 50 characters is able to suffice the needs in most situations. For long addresses that exceeds the 50 character limit, the compromise is to use shorforms, such as b123 instead of block 123.

Examples:
* `addc ic/S1234567D p/91234567`
* `addc ic/S1234567D p/91234567 e/test@email.com `
* `addc ic/S1234567D p/91234567 e/test@email.com a/123, Clementi Rd, 1234665`

## FAQ

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Clinic home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **Regarding the edit command**, the appointment does not reflect an edited person's name correctly
3. **Regarding the undo command**, the undo command does not undo the deleted appointments associated to a person
4. **Regarding the appointments**, the deletion of patient data via 'delete' does not clear the data for the appointments.
